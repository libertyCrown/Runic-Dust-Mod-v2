Runic-Dust-Mod-v2
=================

Hello, and welcome to the official repo of the Runic Dust Mod continuation project.  This repo is/will be designed to 
allow for collaboration on what is one of the larger continuation projects out there.

If you want to submit a code change, make a pull request and I will see if it should be merged into the branch; they usually 
will unless it is something stupid (such as throwing a ton of spam into the minecraft log for no real reason).

Localizations
=============

If you want to help translate the mod into a certain language, just look into the en_US.lang file (which is found in the
assets/runicdust/lang directory) for the item, block, and tile namings.  Then, just make a pull request and I will add it 
to the repo ASAP.
